HW 2: 15 pts
HW 3: P1 = -0.5 pts No filter on nginx official images
      P4 = -0.5 pts No HTML response from nginx container
      P5 = -0.5 pts No good ps fax output
      Total = 13.5 pts
HW 4: Part 1 = 10 pts
      Part 2 = 5 pts Dockerfile missing ENTRYPOINT command.  The docker-compose.yml is ok.      Total = 15 points
HW 5: 20 pts
Quiz: Q1 = 5 pts
      Q2 = 5 pts
      Q3 = 4 pts mostly okay, was looking for more a timeline of steps/interaction from client to dockerd to containerd to runc (with 2 paths; cached or via registery). You mentioned container vs image vs layer, but glossed over how union file system works (like what if same path/file is in two layers).
      Q4 = 1 pt. I specifically asked not to use Swarm overlay commands.  Two valid approaches; mvlan and bridge with gateway containers.
      Q5 = 1 pt. Docker secrets is a Swarm command. I asked you to use one of the methods discussed in clasee like passing via environment variables or mounting a tmpfs volume.
      Total points = 16 points

Grand total points = 94.5 out of 110 maximum = 85.9%
